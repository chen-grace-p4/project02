# 1/13/2022
4:11 PM **Grace**: added basic files from prev assignment for server and multiple clients
<br>

# 1/17/2022
11:37 PM **Grace**: changed server to the select server file given. edited it so that it sends something from one client to every client except itself. client side is still a bit weird when receiving messages (only receiving after sending own message)
<br>

# 1/18/2022
12:23 AM **Grace**: fixed it so that a client can now send multiple messages without receiving a message to other clients. however, client still needs to send something to receive messages correctly.
<br><br>
10:56 AM **Grace**: made it so that program can detect client "commands" in front of a message and made it so when they send update, they get the most recent messages
<br>

# 1/19/2022
10:57 AM **Grace**: realized we need to use select for client side as well for it to work correctly, so changed some comments and plan/setup files for select
<br>

# 1/21/2022
10:57 AM **Grace**: continued setting up files for a selectclient
<br>

# 1/23/2022
7:27 PM **Grace**: completed basic client side using select so that messages can properly be received and sent simultaneously now
<br><br>
9:04 PM **Grace**: added usernames to distinguish between clients on server file and fixed some formatting issues
<br><br>
11:38 PM **Grace**: added proper "flags" for the user and trimmed the flag off the message sent so it looks better
<br>

# 1/24/2022
